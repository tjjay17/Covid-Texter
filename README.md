# Covid-Texter:Overview
This is a bot made using selenium to scrape the Ontario cases and text them using the Twilio library. Time Can be saved as opposed to searching or having to watch the news.

# How To Use
After cloning the project, you would have to install Twilio, selenium and have the chrome webdriver installed.
You will need to setup a personal free (or paid) Twilio account and add that to the 'from_' part and also add in phone numbers that you wish to send the text to in the phone numbers array.
